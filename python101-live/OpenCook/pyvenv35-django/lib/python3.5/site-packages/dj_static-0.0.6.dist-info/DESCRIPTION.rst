dj-static
~~~~~~~~~

This is a simple Django middleware utility that allows you to properly
serve static assets from production with a WSGI server like Gunicorn.

Django `doesn't recommend <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/howto/static-files/#admonition-serving-the-files>`_
the production use of its static file server for a number of reasons.
There exists, however, a lovely WSGI application aptly named `Static <http://lukearno.com/projects/static/>`_.

It is suitable for the production use of static file serving, unlike Django.

Usage
-----

Configure your static assets in ``settings.py``::

   STATIC_ROOT = 'staticfiles'
   STATIC_URL = '/static/'

Then, update your ``wsgi.py`` file to use dj-static::

    from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
    from dj_static import Cling

    application = Cling(get_wsgi_application())
